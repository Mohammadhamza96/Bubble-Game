[ðŸ”— Bubble Game Live]  (https://mohammadhamza96.github.io/js-projects/)



Bubble Game ðŸŽ¯ is a simple, interactive web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player is challenged to click on the correct bubble that matches a randomly generated target number within a 60-second countdown. Each correct click increases the score, and the bubbles refresh instantly. The game also includes features such as a restart button, pause/resume controls, sound effects, and high score tracking using local storage. This project helped me improve my DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI/UX design skills. It's lightweight, responsive, and fun to play â€” perfect for beginners learning JavaScript and game logic.
